promts:
given run_clean.py that I have, that is running like run_benchmark.py, but without the overhead of pyperformnace lib, I want you to write similar tests for the following benhmarks:
1 crypto_pyaes
2 Deepcopy
3 Logging
4 Mdp
5 Pathlib
6 Pickle and pickle_dict
7 Pyflate
8 unpack_sequence
9 json_dumps
10 gc_collect
